# 3rd Place
This is meant to be a Reddit-like content sharing website with a backend written entirely in C, and a bare-bones frontend built with only basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For some reason I really like to do everything myself. Probably unnecessary, but I like the challenge. The backend is about 60% complete (estimating here). So far it can serve up templated files for the front-end in response to GET requests, but no capacity for POST, DELETE, or UPDATE yet. A rough sketch of the database schema has been mapped out, but probably needs work. Not screenshots yet, but hoping to get this website done by January.
